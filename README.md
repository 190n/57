This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in _Exercises for
Programmers_ by Brian P. Hogan.

Structure
---------

The top-level folders represent each chapter: `ch2`, `ch3`, etc. (Chapter 2 is
the first one with any exercises.) The folders within each chapter's folder
contain solutions to each exercise, named for the number of the exercise. Inside
that folder are either a bunch of source files (for exercises that fit in one
file) or, for the application exercises, folders named for the technology I used
to solve it.
